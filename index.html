      <h2>What If the Buddha Had Been a Woman?</h2>
      <p>What if the Buddha had been a woman?<br />
      She leaves her sleeping child to seek the truth.<br />
      And the world calls her selfish — not enlightened.</p>

      <p>It’s a question that cuts deep. Not into doctrine, but into the collective bias we’ve inherited...</p>

      <blockquote>“We all have the same potential. The Buddha gave equal opportunity to men and women.”</blockquote>

      <p>In Buddhism, what matters is <strong>intention</strong>...</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tārā</strong>... </li>
        <li><strong>Prajñāpāramitā</strong>... </li>
        <li><strong>Yeshe Tsogyal</strong>... </li>
        <li><strong>Maha Pajapati Gotami</strong>... </li>
      </ul>

      <p>And maybe, just maybe — <strong>she wasn’t running away. She was walking toward truth.</strong></p>

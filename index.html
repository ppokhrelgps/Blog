      <h2>What If the Buddha Had Been a Woman?</h2>
      <p>What if the Buddha had been a woman?<br />
      She leaves her sleeping child to seek the truth.<br />
      And the world calls her selfish — not enlightened.</p>

      <p>It’s a question that cuts deep. Not into doctrine, but into the collective bias we’ve inherited. In a world that venerates sacrifice when made by men, but calls it abandonment when done by women, what room is left for female awakening?</p>

  <p>His Holiness the Dalai Lama has long taught that <em>enlightenment is not limited by gender</em>. He has said again and again: <blockquote>
    “We all have the same potential. The Buddha gave equal opportunity to men and women.”
  </blockquote>
  He even suggests that his own reincarnation could be female — if the world needs it.</p>

  <p>In Buddhism, what matters is <strong>intention</strong> — the clarity of the heart, not the shape of the body.</p>

  <p>If a woman walked away from all that tethered her — not out of ego, but out of a deep wish to awaken for the benefit of all beings — is that not compassion in its highest form?</p>

  <p>This isn’t hypothetical. It’s historical.</p>

   <ul>
    <li><strong>Tārā</strong>, the beloved female bodhisattva of compassion, vowed to always be reborn as a woman to challenge the notion that only men could become enlightened.</li>
    <li><strong>Prajñāpāramitā</strong>, the “Mother of All Buddhas,” is the very embodiment of transcendent wisdom.</li>
    <li><strong>Yeshe Tsogyal</strong>, the great Tibetan yogini, reached full awakening and is revered to this day.</li>
    <li><strong>Maha Pajapati Gotami</strong>, the Buddha’s own aunt, became the first ordained nun and helped establish the bhikkhunī sangha for generations of women seekers.</li>
  </ul>

      <p>These women did not wait for permission to be free.<br>
  They stepped onto the path — and walked it with courage, clarity, and compassion.</p>

  <p>So when we hear:<br>
  <em>“A woman left her child to find herself.”</em><br>
  And the world says:<br>
  <em>“How selfish.”</em><br>
  We might pause… and remember that the world has always misjudged women who wake up.</p>

  <p>And maybe, just maybe — <strong>she wasn’t running away. She was walking toward truth.</strong></p>
